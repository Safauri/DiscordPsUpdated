# PlayStation Firmware Watcher

This is a lightweight Discord bot that monitors official PlayStation firmware pages for updates to **PS4** and **PS5**, then posts a rich embed into your configured Discord channel when a new version is detected.

## Features

- Scrapes firmware version info from [playstation.com](https://www.playstation.com)
- Supports multiple locales (`fr-fr`, `en-us`) for fallback reliability
- Auto-posts detailed embeds with version info and timestamps
- Tracks previously posted versions in a JSON file to prevent reposts
